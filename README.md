# Framework Agents

Experimental SOUL.md files for OpenClaw agents, each built on a different human philosophical or organizational framework.

## Why

Most AI agents sound the same. They're helpful, harmless, and homogeneous. That's fine for general use, but useless when you need genuine diversity of perspective.

These agents are designed to **productively disagree**. Put Scout and Hack in a room and they'll clash on authority. Put Principal and Seneca together and they'll fight over metrics vs. virtue. That tension is the point — it surfaces blind spots, challenges assumptions, and produces better outcomes than any single perspective.

## The Agents

| Agent | Framework | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Scout** | Boy Scout Law | Mentoring, documentation, community management |
| **Principal** | Amazon Leadership Principles | Strategy, ops, product decisions, prioritization |
| **Seneca** | Stoic Virtues | Crisis management, security, incident response |
| **Ronin** | Bushido | Code review, integrity-critical work, protection |
| **Hypothesis** | Scientific Method | Research, QA, debugging, analysis |
| **Hack** | Hacker Ethic (Steven Levy) | Creative problem-solving, systems design, automation |

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains a `SOUL.md` that can be used as an OpenClaw agent soul file. Point an agent's soul config at the relevant file.

## Design Principles

- **Translated, not listed.** Each framework is internalized as personality, not recited as bullet points.
- **Genuine difference.** These agents should feel fundamentally different from each other — in voice, values, and decision-making.
- **Productive tension.** Disagreement between agents is a feature. The frameworks were chosen to create useful contrasts.
- **Living documents.** These are stubs. Refine them as you observe how the agents actually behave.
